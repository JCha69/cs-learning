# Problem 1 (Easy)

# creates the grocery list
grocery = ["milk", "eggs", "bread"]

# prints the length of the list
print(len(grocery))

# prints each item in a bulletpoint
for item in grocery:
    print("- %s" % item)

# appends a new item
grocery.append("bananas")

# prints the updated list
print(grocery)


# Problem 2 (Medium)

# creates the list for names and scores
names = ["James", "Kate", "Josh", "Aiden", "Mia"]
scores = [80, 94, 25, 100, 79]

# prints each student's name and score
for name, score in zip(names, scores):
    print(f"{name} got {score}")

# prints the average score of the class
totalScore = 0

for score in scores:
    totalScore += score

average = totalScore / len(scores)

print(average)

# prints the number of students who scored above 80
above80 = 0

for score in scores:
    if score >= 80 : above80 += 1

print(above80)

# Problem 3 (Hard)

# for each name, print the length of the name and wheter the name contains "a"
tof = "Yes"

for name in names:
    if name.lower().find("a") != -1 : 
        tof = "Yes"
    else :
        tof = "No"
    print(f"{name} - {len(name)} letters - contains 'a' : {tof}")

# count how many names have more than 4 letters & contain the letter "j"
moreThan4 = 0
containsJ = 0

for name in names:
    if len(name) > 4 : 
        moreThan4 += 1
    if name.lower().find("j") != -1 :
        containsJ += 1

print(f"Names with more than 4 letters : {moreThan4}")
print(f"Names containing 'j' : {containsJ}")
